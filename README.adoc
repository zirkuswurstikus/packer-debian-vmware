A Packer configuration to build a Debian 12.9 ARM64 box for VMware Fusion on Apple Silicon Macs.
This project is primarily for personal lab environments, but feel free to use it as you see fit.

== Requirements

* VMware Fusion (Apple Silicon)
* Packer 1.11.2
* Vagrant with vmware_desktop plugin
* Git
* make

== Quick Start

[source,bash]
----
# Install Packer, Vagrant, Git and make
brew install packer vagrant git make

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/packer-debian-vmware
cd packer-debian-vmware
make all
----

== Configuration

The following variables can be configured in the Makefile:

=== Cache and Output Directories
* `PACKER_CACHE_DIR`: Base cache directory (default: `/tmp/packer_cache`)
* `OUT_DIR`: Output directory for box file (default: `/tmp/packer_cache/out`)

=== VM Configuration
* `VM_NAME`: Name shown in VMware Fusion (default: `"Packer_Debian_12.9_arm64"`)
* `VM_CPUS`: Number of CPUs (default: `8`)
* `VM_MEMORY`: Memory in MB (default: `2048`)

=== ISO Configuration
* `ISO_URL`: URL to Debian netinstall ISO
* `ISO_CHECKSUM`: SHA512 checksum of ISO

== Available Make Targets

* `all`: Run complete workflow (build and test)
* `build`: Build the VMware box
* `test`: Test the box with Vagrant
* `clean`: Clean up build artifacts
* `init`: Initialize Packer plugins

== Common Issues

=== 1. VNC Connection Refused
Error: "error connecting to VNC: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:5989: connect: connection refused"

Fix: Reset VMware Fusion:
[source,bash]
----
sudo pkill -f "VMware Fusion" && sleep 3 && open -a "VMware Fusion"
----

=== 2. Duplicate Variables
Error: "Duplicate variable definition found"

Fix: Ensure only one .pkr.hcl file exists with variable definitions
